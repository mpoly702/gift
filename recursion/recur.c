In recursion, the "recursive condition" refers to the condition that determines when a recursive function should make a recursive call to itself. This condition governs the termination of the recursion and helps in breaking down a larger problem into smaller subproblems.

A recursive function typically has two types of conditions:

1. **Base Case(s):** These are the conditions under which the recursion stops. When a base case is met, the function returns a result without making any further recursive calls. Base cases are essential to prevent infinite recursion and to ensure that the recursion reaches a stopping point. They provide the "exit" condition for the recursion.

2. **Recursive Case(s):** These are the conditions under which the recursive function calls itself with a modified or simpler version of the original problem. Recursive cases are used to break down the original problem into smaller subproblems, and they guide the recursion toward the base case(s). Recursive cases determine when the function continues making recursive calls.

The recursive condition, in essence, is part of the recursive case(s). It's the condition that checks whether the current problem can be further divided into smaller subproblems. If the recursive condition evaluates to true, the function makes a recursive call with a modified version of the problem (typically with different arguments), thus progressing toward the base case(s).

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept:

```c
void countdown(int n) {
    // Base case
    if (n == 0) {
        printf("Blastoff!\n");
    } else {
        // Recursive condition
        printf("%d, ", n);
        countdown(n - 1); // Recursive call
    }
}
```

In this example, the base case is when `n` equals 0, and the function prints "Blastoff!" and returns. The recursive condition checks if `n` is not 0, and if true, it prints the value of `n` and makes a recursive call with `n - 1`, thus counting down towards the base case.

So, in the context of recursion, the recursive condition is the condition that guides the recursion by deciding when to continue making recursive calls and when to reach the base case(s) for termination.
