This code defines a C function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n using recursion. Let's break down the code and comment on it:

c
Copy code
#include "main.h"
This line includes the header file "main.h," which likely contains function prototypes and other necessary declarations.

c
Copy code
/**
 * factorial - fills memory with a constant byte.
 * @n: first bytes of the memory
 * Return: -
 */
These are comments that provide documentation for the factorial function. The comments include a brief description of what the function does and describe the function's parameter:

factorial is the name of the function.
@n is an integer parameter representing the number for which the factorial is calculated.
Return: - indicates that the function returns an integer value.
c
Copy code
int factorial(int n)
{
	if (n < 0)
	{
		return (-1);
	}
Here, the factorial function is defined. It takes an integer n as its parameter. The function first checks if n is less than 0. If n is negative, it returns -1. This is a signal that the input is invalid because factorials are defined for non-negative integers. Returning -1 in this case is a common way to indicate an error condition.

c
Copy code
	if (n == 0)
	{
		return (1);
	}
Next, the function checks if n is equal to 0. If n is 0, it returns 1. This is because the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1, and this serves as the base case for the recursion.

c
Copy code
	return (n * factorial(n - 1));
If neither of the above conditions is met, the function uses recursion to calculate the factorial of n. It multiplies n by the factorial of n - 1 (i.e., it calls itself with n - 1 as the argument). This recursive process continues until n reaches 0, at which point the function starts returning and multiplying the results to calculate the factorial of the original n.

In summary, this code defines a recursive function factorial that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n. It checks for invalid inputs (negative n) and defines the base case (factorial of 0) before using recursion to compute the factorial of the given number.
